### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working my way through Project [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). My progress can be found [here](https://github.com/maccotter11/Project-Euler). Post graduation I am having fun taking the scenic route through the worlds of [Group Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) and [Real Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis#:~:text=Real%20analysis%20is%20an%20area,form%20the%20extended%20real%20line.). As an avid Chicago Cubs fan, I am using sabermetrics as a vehicle for learning about numerical analysis and statistical modeling. 

I am happily married and have a dog name Wrigley. I enjoy reading, gaming, spending time with my family and traveling.

Possbile future projects include: 
* Program that gives a summary of how a specific baseball team or player did over a specified time frame using [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball). Possibly a set it and foget it structure where the summary is emailed to you at a cadence of your choosing. 
* A study of the [Top Ten Algorithms in Applied Mathematics](https://nhigham.com/2016/03/29/the-top-10-algorithms-in-applied-mathematics/).
* A program that will draw groups. Possibly using Grant Sanderson's [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
